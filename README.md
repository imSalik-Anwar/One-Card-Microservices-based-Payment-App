# One-Card-Microservices-based-Payment-App

I created a microservices-based Spring Boot application, a digital payment platform for parents and guardians. Its core purpose is to enable remote management of children's expenses. The app consists of three microservices: Profile Service (user registration and updates), Card Service (spending control and card management), and Transaction Service (financial transaction management).

**Key Features** ======================================================================

Effortless Registration: Guardians can register themselves and their children, automatically generating a digital payment card for each child. This simplifies family financial management.

Card Service: This enables setting spending limits, adding funds, activating/deactivating cards, and blocking them. This ensures control over financial transactions.

Transaction Management: The Transaction Service records various transaction types, allowing parents to monitor and ensure accurate financial records.

**Advanced Features** ================================================================

Role-Based Authentication: Different roles for guardians and children enhance data security, permitting only authorized access.

Independent Microservices: The microservices operate independently, offering scalability, robustness, and simplified maintenance.

API Gateway: An API gateway serves as a centralized entry point, streamlining user interactions and inter-service communication.

Secure Password Update: The app features secure password updates, incorporating a verification process for added account security.

This project exemplifies my expertise in Spring Boot, database management, RESTful API development, and system integration. It prioritizes operational efficiency, user engagement, and data security, making it a valuable addition to my portfolio.
